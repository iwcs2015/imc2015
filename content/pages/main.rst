:summary: The aim of the IWCS conference is to bring together researchers
  interested in any aspects of the computation, annotation, extraction, and
  representation of meaning in natural language, whether this is from a lexical or
  structural semantic perspective. IWCS embraces both symbolic and statistical
  approaches to computational semantics, and everything in between.
