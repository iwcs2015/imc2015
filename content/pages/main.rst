IMC - Interactive Meaning Construction
======================================

| A workshop in conjunction with `IWCS 2015`_
| Queen Mary University of London, 14th April 2015

--------------------------------------------------

IMC (Interactive Meaning Construction) is a workshop to be held at the
`11th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS 2015)`_
at `Queen Mary University of London`_, UK on 14th April 2015.

Despite being the mainstay of our language experience, the data of
conversational dialogue pose very considerable challenges for semantic
modelling. They violate expectations provided by standard frameworks,
with apparently incomplete and/or highly context-dependent fragments
widespread. Conventional grammar frameworks are poorly set up to
reflect these dynamics, but the goal of defining models able to
reflect them is an active research area. However, dialogue phenomena
and data provide us with evidence about intended and understood
meaning which can help define more suitable approaches, either through
inspection or through computational methods (especially given the
recent progress in distributional and inferential methods for deriving
semantic representations and parsers from context). This workshop
brings together researchers addressing these issues and assesses the
significance of this ongoing work both for approaches to semantics and
for computational modelling.
