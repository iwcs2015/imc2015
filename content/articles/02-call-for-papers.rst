11th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS)
Queen Mary University of London, UK
14-17th April, 2015

http://sigsem.org/iwcs2015

**Paper submission deadline: 16th December, 2014**

The aim of the IWCS conference is to bring together researchers interested in the computation, annotation, extraction, and representation of meaning in natural language, whether from a lexical or structural semantic perspective. IWCS embraces both symbolic and statistical approaches to computational semantics, and everything in between.

Topics of interest
==================

The areas of interest for the conference include all computational aspects of meaning of natural language within written, spoken, or multimodal communication. Papers are invited on topics in these and closely related areas, including the following:

*    representation of meaning
*    syntax-semantics interface
*    representing and resolving semantic ambiguity
*    shallow and deep semantic processing and reasoning
*    hybrid symbolic and statistical approaches to representing semantics
*    alternative approaches to compositional semantics
*    inference methods for computational semantics
*    recognizing textual entailment
*    learning by reading
*    methodologies and practices for semantic annotation
*    machine learning of semantic structures
*    statistical semantics
*    computational aspects of lexical semantics
*    semantics and ontologies
*    semantic web and natural language processing
*    semantic aspects of language generation
*    semantic relations in discourse and dialogue
*    semantics and pragmatics of dialogue acts
*    multimodal and grounded approaches to computing meaning
*    semantics-pragmatics interface

Submission Requirements
=======================

Two types of submission are solicited: long papers and short papers.
Both types of papers should be submitted not later than 16th December, 2014.

Long papers should describe original research and must not exceed 10 pages. They will be published in the conference proceedings and in the ACL Anthology, and will have a full oral presentation at the conference.

Short papers (typically system or project descriptions, or ongoing research) must not exceed 5 pages. They will be published in the conference proceedings and in the ACL Anthology, and will have a lightning talk at the conference, followed by a poster/demo session for discussion.

Papers should be electronically submitted in PDF format via the START system at https://www.softconf.com/iwcs2015/. Please contact the organisers if you have problems using START.

Please follow the information for authors for instructions on formatting your paper, given on the conference webpage
http://sigsem.org/iwcs2015/.
